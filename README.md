Income Prediction from Census Data
Overview
This project aims to predict income levels based on demographic and financial attributes using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is the Adult dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and income bracket classified as ">50K" or "<=50K".

Dataset Description
The Adult dataset comprises demographic and financial attributes of individuals. It includes both categorical and numerical features, making it suitable for classification tasks. The target variable is the income bracket, which indicates whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year.

Solution Methodology
Two machine learning models are employed for income prediction:

NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier
Random Forest Classification
These models are chosen for their simplicity, effectiveness, and suitability for binary classification tasks with mixed data types.


Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated on both the test set and through cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization performance.
